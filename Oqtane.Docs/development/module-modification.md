# Module Modification

I developed this as a proof-of-concept custom module that was edited based on the default custom module from Oqtane. 
I began with the default module that was generated by Oqtane. 

Then I changed some files using Visual Studio, using the writeup at [Michael Washington's Blazor Helpsite](https://blazorhelpwebsite.com/ViewBlogPost/4) as a guide. 
The files that I changed are as follows. 

**/Shared/Models/Module.cs** - Added fields to the module definition 

**/Server/Migrations/EntityBuilders/[Module]EntityBuilder.cs** - Add new fields in 2 places:

```
protected override [Module]EntityBuilder BuildTable(ColumnsBuilder) Table {
    ...
}

public OperationBuilder<AddColumnOperation> MyNewFieldName { get; set; }
```

**/Client/Modules/Edit.razor** - Changed 5 different places for each field. Michael's write-up can be used as a guide. 

Once these changes were made, then I could compile it and it shows up as a module with the fields that were added from these changes.
