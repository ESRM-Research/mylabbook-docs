## Colors and Icons

APIs can be daunting. Because of this, we've color-coded the menu to the left and added icons to make it easier for you to get around. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is what the colors and icons in the TOC mean:
> * Anything that's <span class="priority-internal">light gray / subdued</span> is probably not of interest to you<br/>
> * <span class="priority-web"></span> marks WebApi related things <br/>
> * <span class="priority-data"></span> marks things related to data like models and repositories<br/>
> * <span class="priority-module"></span> marks Module related things <br/>
> * <span class="priority-theme"></span> marks things related to themes <br/>


These areas are probably what you would like to research
