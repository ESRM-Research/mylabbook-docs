# Introduction to MyLabBook

![introductionbanner](./assets/introduction-banner.png)

MyLabBook is an open source and cross-platform modular Electronic Lab Notebook for building single-page applications on .NET. 
It is based on the [Oqtane framework](https://oqtane.org) and uses reusable web UI components that are implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. 
Both the client and server code is written in C#, providing a consistent and efficient development experience.


### Blazing a New Trail
Since MyLabBook is based on Oqtane, it utilizes Blazor, the revolutionary new development framework from Microsoft that lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. 
MyLabBook supports both the Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly hosting models.


### Open Source
MyLabBook is available under the industry standard MIT open source license.


### Cross Platform
MyLabBook is a native .NET Core application and can be used on all major enterprise IT platforms. It currently supports SQL Server, MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL databases.


### Modular Architecture
MyLabBook has a modular architecture which allows it to serve as an integration fabric for building composite applications. 
Because it is built on the Oqtane framework, MyLabBook can be easily extended with custom modules and themes. 
Modules are created as standard .NET Core applications using Blazor components for the UI and can be developed, packaged and installed independently 
from the Oqtane framework. The framework utilizes open web UI standards (ie. HTML and CSS3) as well as Bootstrap 5 as the default CSS framework for creating modern user experiences.


### Multi-Tenant
MyLabBook can serve the needs of multiple clients from a single installation. It supports both shared and isolated tenancy models to enable you to comply with data privacy regulations.


### Composite UI
MyLabBook provides the capability for an admnistrator to dynamically construct a page from existing components without writing any code.


### Headless API
MyLabBook provides a rich set of secure REST-based core APIs which can be leveraged in custom modules. Swagger integration is included by default to simplify API integration.
