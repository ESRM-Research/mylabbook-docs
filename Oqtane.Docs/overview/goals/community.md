# Open Source Community

There are many factors that make up a vibrant open source community. A key ingredient is of course an excellent product that meets the needs of its users. That is currently our first priority. 
After we finish our  first Minimum Viable Product (MVP), then it will be easier to understand the advantages of our current approach with Oqtane. We always welcome your feedback.
