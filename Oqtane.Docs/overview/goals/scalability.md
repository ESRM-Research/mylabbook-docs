# Scalability of Platforms

Since a main goal is to create a free and open source platform that is available to nearly all academic institutions, we want to allow  
the software to run on inexpensive computing platforms like a Raspberry Pi. On the other hand, some simulations for science require 
significant computer resources. We want to be able to run on this spectrum of platforms so that no matter where your research is 
performed that the hosting research platform will not be a hindrance to your progress.
