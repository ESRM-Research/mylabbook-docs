# Cross-Platform Goal

The foundations of MyLabBook are .Net Core, Blazor, and Oqtane. All of these platforms have been designed to be cross platform across 
Windows, Linux, and MacOS. However, in practival matters the platforms still seem to work most seamlessly with Microsoft tools on the 
Windows platform. Over time, the cross-platform capabilities have improvedtremendously and should continue to improve at a good pace.
