# Cross Platform Capabilities

The underlying technologies of MyLabBook are [.NET Core](), [Blazor](), and [Oqtane](https://oqtane.org). These technologies are all designed to 
be cross platform across Windows, Linux and MacOS. However, in practice, it seems that the platform currently works most robustly on the 
Windows platform with Microsoft Visual Studio. Progress is being made in the cross-platform and multi-database capabilities and we consider
this a priority to achieve in an expedient way.
